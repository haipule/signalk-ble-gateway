# Signal K Victron BLE Consumer

This standalone consumer receives generic advertisement events from the
gateway provider, selects configured Victron devices, and decrypts Instant
Readout data exclusively on the Signal K server.

It requires Signal K Server 2.31 or newer, which provides the official BLE
Provider API.

## Installation

Install `signalk-victron-ble-consumer` from the Signal K AppStore, then enable
and configure it under **Server > Plugin Config**. Version 0.2.0 is the stable
release for the official Signal K BLE Provider API.

## Development installation

```sh
cd consumer-plugin
npm link
cd ~/.signalk
npm link signalk-victron-ble-consumer
```

Restart Signal K, enable the plugin, and configure each device with a stable
ID, display name, BLE MAC address, and 32-character advertisement key. The
gateway provider must be enabled at the same time.

The diagnostic web application is available at:

```text
http://SIGNALK-SERVER:3000/signalk-victron-ble-consumer/
```

Keys are never returned by the status API or web application.

Lynx Smart BMS voltage, current, state of charge, time remaining, and
temperature are published below `electrical.batteries.<id>`. The web
application additionally shows consumed capacity, BMS error, I/O status, and
warning/alarm bit fields.

Orion XS is published as a charger:

```text
electrical.chargers.<id>.voltage
electrical.chargers.<id>.current
electrical.chargers.<id>.inputVoltage
electrical.chargers.<id>.inputCurrent
```

State, error code, and shutdown reason remain diagnostic-only. Unknown record
types stay visible as raw data and never produce guessed measurements.
