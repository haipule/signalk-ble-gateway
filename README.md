# Signal K BLE Gateway

An open Victron consumer and deployment reference built on the
[`dirkwa/sensesp-ble-gateway`](https://github.com/dirkwa/sensesp-ble-gateway)
transport for distributed Signal K BLE coverage.

The project deliberately separates transport, Signal K integration, and
manufacturer-specific decoding:

```text
BLE devices -> ESP32 gateway -> official remote gateway HTTP API
            -> Signal K BLE Provider API -> consumer plugins -> Signal K
```

The ESP32 forwards raw BLE advertisements. It does not contain Victron logic,
decryption keys, or Signal K paths. Manufacturer logic runs exclusively in
server-side consumer plugins.

## Current status: 0.2.0 stable

This version requires Signal K Server 2.31 or newer and uses the official BLE
Provider API delivered by PR #2588. The working legacy implementation remains
available as `v0.1.0-rc.1` and on the 0.1 release line.

## Why this project is different

This is a Victron consumer for Signal K's new BLE Provider API, built on the
SensESP BLE Gateway transport and distributed ESP32 BLE gateways. The consumer
subscribes to `app.bleApi` advertisements; it
does not open a local BlueZ adapter, scan `hci0`, or compete with other BLE
plugins for hardware access. Gateways can be placed in separate engine rooms,
cabins, or other areas of a vessel while Signal K receives one unified stream.

The project is therefore complementary to direct local-BLE Victron plugins:
it focuses on remote, multi-gateway coverage and clean separation between BLE
transport and Victron decoding. It is a publicly documented Victron consumer
built specifically around the new Signal K BLE Provider API.

- passive BLE scanning on an ESP32,
- bounded advertisement queues and HTTP batches with retry/backoff,
- authenticated batches to Signal K's built-in remote BLE provider,
- consumer subscription through `app.bleApi`,
- server-side Victron advertisement decryption,
- Lynx Smart BMS decoding,
- Orion XS decoding,
- SmartSolar MPPT decoding,
- Orion Smart DC-DC decoding,
- Orion Signal K output paths verified on a live server,
- provider and consumer lifecycle separation verified,
- automated provider and consumer tests passing,
- ESP32 firmware build passing.

## Victron device support

Support refers to decoded BLE advertisement data and published Signal K
values. Device recognition alone is not considered support.

| Victron family | Record | Status | Signal K output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lynx Smart BMS | `0x0A` | Supported and tested | `electrical.batteries.<device-id>` |
| Orion XS | `0x0F` | Supported and tested | `electrical.chargers.<device-id>` |
| SmartSolar MPPT | `0x01` | Decoder verified against the published specification and reference vectors | `electrical.solar.<device-id>` |
| Orion Smart DC-DC | `0x04` | Decoder verified against the published specification and reference vectors | `electrical.chargers.<device-id>` |
| SmartShunt / BMV | `0x02` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | `electrical.batteries.<device-id>` |
| Phoenix Inverter | `0x03` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | `electrical.inverters.<device-id>` |
| SmartLithium | `0x05` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | `electrical.batteries.<device-id>` |
| Inverter RS | `0x06` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | `electrical.inverters.<device-id>` |
| Smart Battery Protect | `0x09` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | diagnostic only |
| Multi RS | `0x0B` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | diagnostic only |
| VE.Bus | `0x0C` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | diagnostic only |
| DC Energy Meter | `0x0D` | Decoder from the specification, **untested**, no hardware | diagnostic only |
| GX Device | `0x07` | Not implemented; the specification marks the layout undetermined | — |
| AC Charger | `0x08` | Not implemented; the specification marks the layout undetermined | — |
| Smart Battery Sense | — | Uses the battery monitor record; **untested** | `electrical.batteries.<device-id>` |

Records marked untested decode the layout published in the Victron "Extra
manufacturer data" specification, with fixture-driven tests built from that
document. No hardware was available to confirm them, so treat their values as
unverified until someone reports a comparison against VictronConnect.

Four records decode but publish nothing to Signal K, shown above as diagnostic
only. Signal K has no battery-protect, Multi, VE.Bus or DC-meter group, and
placing their measurements below an unrelated group would misdescribe the
device. Their decoded values appear in the plugin status API and the web
application.

Additional device families will be marked supported only after we have real
advertisement captures, a verified decoder, fixture-based tests, and confirmed
Signal K paths. See the [Victron coverage roadmap](TODO.md#priority-7-expand-victron-ble-coverage)
for the current development order.

Lynx Smart BMS values are published below:

```text
electrical.batteries.<device-id>
```

Because the current Signal K schema has no dedicated DC/DC charger group,
Orion XS values are published as a charger:

```text
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.voltage
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.current
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.inputVoltage
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.inputCurrent
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.chargingMode
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.chargerState
electrical.chargers.<device-id>.chargerError
```

The 0.2.0 release passed a 90-hour endurance run on stable power. The
acceptance record is in
[`docs/test-record-2026-08-22.md`](docs/test-record-2026-08-22.md). A
previously observed brownout was a supply reset, not a firmware stability
failure.

GATT remains outside the advertisement MVP. The gateway WebSocket will be
implemented only when a consumer needs GATT.

## Components

- `firmware/`: project firmware integration using the SensESP BLE Gateway
  transport
- `consumer-plugin/`: Victron decoder and diagnostic web application
- `docs/`: architecture, protocol, operation, testing, and roadmap

## Quick start

1. Install Signal K Server 2.31 or newer.
2. Install and configure `consumer-plugin/` for the Victron devices.
3. Copy `firmware/secrets.example.h` to
   `firmware/include/secrets.h` and enter local credentials.
4. Build and flash the ESP32 from `firmware/`.

Keep the `v0.1.x` installation available for rollback until the 0.2 firmware
has passed the long-duration hardware test.

Detailed installation and acceptance instructions are in
[`docs/15-Operations-and-Diagnostics.md`](docs/15-Operations-and-Diagnostics.md).
The release scope and remaining work are tracked in
[`docs/14-Roadmap.md`](docs/14-Roadmap.md).

## Public discussion

The repository is intentionally public to support architecture and protocol
discussion with the Signal K and marine electronics communities. Please open a
GitHub issue for reproducible defects or design proposals. Never post BLE
decryption keys, Signal K access tokens, Wi-Fi credentials, or vessel-specific
network details.
